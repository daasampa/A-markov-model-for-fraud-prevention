This repository was published to share the complete implementation of discrete time Markov chain model whose main purpose is to **_calculate a fraud risk measure_** to clients who deal with digital channels. The mentioned calculation is based on Montecarlo simulation of the model.

[**Markov chains**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) are a suitable way to _model_ [sequencial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_pattern_mining) data either for continuous and discrete time. The model here implemented belongs to a **discrete time-countable states space** class; states who are involved (or not) with fraud state are countable; time could be continuos, but for the sake of save coding efforts was deemed discrete.
